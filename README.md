# Moody Mirror üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Stack Hackers


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sreehari C Nair - College Of Engineering Thalassery
- Member 1: Sooraj O - College Of Engineering Thalassery

### Project Description
Moody Mirror is a web application that uses your webcam to detect your facial expressions in real-time and roasts you with hilarious, personalized insults. It's like having a sarcastic friend trapped in your mirror who never runs out of snarky comments about your face.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are taking themselves too seriously! Facial expressions have become boring and predictable. We noticed a severe lack of sarcastic mirrors that mock you based on how you look. The world needs more pointless humor and less self-esteem.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Moody Mirror combines cutting-edge AI with savage humor to:

1.Analyze your facial expressions using TensorFlow.js

2.Classify your mood (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

3.Generate personalized roasts based on your expression

4.Destroy your self-confidence with surgical precision
